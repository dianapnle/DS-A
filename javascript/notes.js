//for most frequent characters, pair sums, -> use object hash map
    //if it does not already exist in the object -> set to 0, else increase by 1
    //use object to store previous numbers or values already seen

//linked lists
    //has head and tail with the tail pointing to null
    //has order
    //not required to have contiguous memory like arrays


//graphs
    //has depth first or breadth first
    //depth first is stack -> goes in one direction all the way until the next
    //breadth first is queue -> goes to all neighbors first
